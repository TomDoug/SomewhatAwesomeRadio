6/13:	Updated the music server to use flask. Going to localhost/ gives a list of all files in the Music folder. 
	localhost/play/<songtitle> plays a song. localhost/songinfo/<songtitle> gives you the songs info. localhost/pause pauses 
	and localhost/stop stops the music. this still needs to be implemented on the client side.




6/13:	Tabed previous update so I could read it better. Also had some ideas for the physical radio. How do you feel about a wood
	faceplate for the flat part, and leather with studs around the curved part? Eliminates the need to bend wood/metal and
	may look nice. Thoughts?

6/13:	That sounds like it would look really good.
